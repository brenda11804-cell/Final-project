A. **Hallucinated facts**: This refers to AI generating false or misleading information. While this can be a risk, it is more commonly associated with AI models in areas like healthcare, finance, and scientific research rather than in educational settings where factual accuracy is crucial.

B. **Plagiarism/academic integrity issues**: This is a significant concern. AI can generate text that closely resembles human-written content, potentially leading students to submit work that is not their own. This can undermine the integrity of academic work and the learning process.

C. **Privacy/data leakage**: AI systems often rely on large amounts of data to function effectively. If this data includes sensitive information about students, there is a risk of data leakage. Additionally, AI models can sometimes inadvertently capture and store personal data, leading to privacy breaches.

D. **Over-reliance/loss of skills**: One of the major risks is the potential for students to over-rely on AI for tasks that they could perform on their own, such as writing essays, solving math problems, or creating presentations. This can lead to a loss of critical thinking, problem-solving, and other important skills.

Among these, **B (Plagiarism/academic integrity issues)** and **D (Over-reliance/loss of skills)** are the most immediate and significant risks for students. However, if we must choose the most overarching or fundamental risk, **D (Over-reliance/loss of skills)** is the most critical.

"Effect of AI on originality of typical essays
A More original · B No change · C Less original","The impact of AI on the originality of typical essays is a complex issue that can be addressed in several ways. Here are some considerations:

1. **Content Generation**: AI can generate content based on large datasets, which can sometimes lead to content that is highly original in terms of structure, vocabulary, or ideas. This is particularly true for essays that are not based on specific, fixed topics but rather on broad themes or concepts.

2. **Plagiarism Risks**: However, AI-generated content can also be highly similar to existing content, leading to potential issues with plagiarism. If an essay is based on a fixed topic, AI might produce content that closely resembles existing essays on that topic, reducing its originality.

3. **Enhanced Creativity**: AI can aid in creativity by suggesting new angles, structures, and perspectives. This can lead to more innovative and original essays, especially when AI tools are used to generate ideas rather than complete essays.

4. **Redundancy**: If an essay is too closely based on an AI-generated outline or structure, it might lack the unique voice and originality that a human writer can bring to the piece.

5. **Human-Created Content**: Ultimately, AI can enhance human creativity by providing a platform for exploring and refining ideas, but it cannot replace the unique human touch that comes from original thinking and personal expression.

Given these points, the impact of AI on the originality of typical essays is likely to be mixed. For essays that are highly structured and based on fixed topics, AI might reduce originality. For essays that are exploratory and based on broad themes, AI can enhance originality by providing new perspectives and ideas.

So, the answer is likely **B. No change**, as it depends on the specific use and structure of the essay. If the essay is purely based on a given topic or structure, AI might not significantly enhance originality. If it is more exploratory and uses AI to generate ideas, then it can be more original.",/root/autodl-tmp/models/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct,0.7,0.9,1024,TRUE,,2025-11-21T20:20:54.602943
"Impulsive purchases driven by AI recommendations/ads

However, the options you've provided seem to suggest a range from rare to very frequent. Here’s a breakdown:

- **A Rare**: This would imply that the individual does not experience impulsive purchases due to AI recommendations or ads very often.
- **B Occasional (monthly)**: This suggests that the individual experiences impulsive purchases driven by AI recommendations or ads on a monthly basis.
- **C Frequent (weekly)**: This indicates that the individual experiences such purchases on a weekly basis.
- **D Very frequent (multi/week)**: This implies that the individual experiences such purchases multiple times a week.

Given the context, if we had to categorize a typical individual, it might be reasonable to assume that someone who experiences these purchases **occasionally** (monthly) or **frequently (weekly)** would fall into one of these categories. 

Therefore, **B Occasional (monthly)** or **C Frequent (weekly)** could be more representative of the average experience.",/root/autodl-tmp/models/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct,0.7,0.9,1024,TRUE,,2025-11-21T20:20:54.602946
"Most persuasive channel for AI-driven purchases
A TikTok/Reels shopping · B Search ads · C Marketplace recs (Amazon/Temu) · D Creator newsletters","The most persuasive channel for AI-driven purchases can vary based on the specific context, target audience, and product type, but generally, AI-driven recommendation systems and dynamic content are often the most effective. Let's break down each option:

A. **TikTok/Reels shopping:** TikTok's Reels feature includes short-form videos that often feature product placements and influencers. TikTok's AI can analyze user behavior and suggest products that are relevant and interesting to the user based on their past interactions, likes, and watch history. This makes it highly persuasive, especially for younger audiences and those who are interested in social media shopping.

B. **Search ads:** Search ads, particularly those powered by AI, can be highly persuasive if they are relevant to the user's search query and provide a clear, compelling offer. However, search ads often rely more on keyword matching and may not have as much dynamic content or personalized recommendation as TikTok or marketplace recs.

C. **Marketplace recs (Amazon/Temu):** AI-driven recommendations in marketplaces like Amazon or Temu can be highly persuasive due to the depth and breadth of the data available. These platforms use complex algorithms to suggest products based on a user's browsing and purchase history, as well as current trends and user preferences. This personalization can significantly increase the likelihood of a purchase.

D. **Creator newsletters:** Creator newsletters can be persuasive if the content is high-quality, relevant, and engaging. However, they are less likely to be AI-driven and more focused on providing value through content rather than directly driving purchases. The AI aspect is more present in the recommendation systems and not as much in the content itself.

Considering these points, **Marketplace recs (C)**, such as Amazon or Temu, often have the most persuasive AI-driven purchase experience due to their ability to leverage comprehensive data and personalized recommendations. 

However, it's important to note that the effectiveness can vary based on the specific implementation and the user's individual preferences and behaviors.",/root/autodl-tmp/models/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct,0.7,0.9,1024,TRUE,,2025-11-21T20:20:54.602948
"Best practice to curb hallucinations
A Chain-of-thought prompting · B Retrieval/citations · C Lower temperature · D Model switching/ensemble","The best practice to curb hallucinations typically involves a combination of strategies, and in the context of using large language models like Qwen, both A (Chain-of-thought prompting) and C (Lower temperature) are often recommended. Here's a breakdown of each:

**A. Chain-of-thought prompting**: This involves guiding the model to provide a step-by-step explanation of its reasoning process. By asking the model to explain its thought process, you can ensure that the output makes sense and aligns with the input and context. This helps in reducing the likelihood of hallucinations by making the model's reasoning more transparent and verifiable.

**C. Lower temperature**: This refers to setting the temperature hyperparameter of the model lower. The temperature controls the randomness in the model's response. A lower temperature makes the model's responses more deterministic and less likely to produce hallucinations, as it avoids random, nonsensical, or illogical outputs.

**B. Retrieval/citations**: While retrieval and citation-based approaches can help in verifying the correctness of certain outputs, they are not a direct method to curb hallucinations in the model's generated text. They are more relevant in the context of ensuring that the model's responses are consistent with available knowledge and are not purely hallucinations.

**D. Model switching/ensemble**: While using multiple models can sometimes help in reducing hallucinations by leveraging different strengths and perspectives, it is not a direct method to curb hallucinations in the responses of a single model. It's more about ensemble learning techniques.

In summary, for reducing hallucinations in a single model like Qwen, **A (Chain-of-thought prompting)** and **C (Lower temperature)** are the best practices to follow. Combining these methods can significantly improve the quality and reliability of the model's output.",/root/autodl-tmp/models/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct,0.7,0.9,1024,TRUE,,2025-11-21T20:20:54.602951
"Safest default for assignments with sensitive data

A. Opt-out logging & anonymize:
- Opting out of logging can reduce the risk of data being traced back to a user, but it doesn't inherently secure the data itself. Anonymizing data may help protect against re-identification, but this is only as good as the anonymization techniques used.
- This is a good supplementary measure, but it doesn't address the core issue of where the data is stored and who has access to it.

B. Local/offline models:
- Keeping models locally on the user's device or in an offline environment reduces the risk of data being compromised if the cloud service is breached.
- However, this approach may not be practical for all use cases, especially if real-time analysis or model updates are required.

C. Institutional licensed cloud:
- This is often a recommended approach for handling sensitive data, especially when the institution has the necessary security measures and compliance requirements in place.
- Cloud providers with institutional licenses typically offer enhanced security features, compliance with regulations, and regular audits.
- However, there's still a risk of data breaches or misuse, and it depends on the specific security practices of the cloud provider and the institution.

D. Personal free accounts:
- Personal free accounts often come with less stringent security measures and may have higher risks of data breaches.
- This is generally not recommended for handling sensitive data, as it does not provide the necessary level of security and privacy.

Considering these points, the safest default for assignments involving sensitive data would be:

C. Institutional licensed cloud.

This option offers a balance of security, compliance, and usability, provided that the institution has robust security measures in place.

"Assessment most resilient to AI misuse
A Closed-book exams · B Viva/oral defenses · C Project logs with version history · D Group presentations","Among the options provided, the assessment method that is most resilient to AI misuse is:

**C Project logs with version history**

Here's why:

- **Project logs with version history** can be more resilient to AI misuse because they involve more creative and critical thinking. Students need to understand and apply complex concepts, solve problems, and communicate effectively. Additionally, maintaining a version history allows students to demonstrate their learning process and evolution over time, making it harder for AI to replicate without understanding the underlying concepts.

- **Closed-book exams** can be somewhat vulnerable to AI misuse since they rely on students' ability to recall information, which AI can potentially replicate through memorization. However, this method still requires students to understand and apply the information rather than simply recalling it.

- **Viva/oral defenses** are also challenging for AI to replicate. This method requires students to articulate their understanding and reasoning, engage in critical thinking, and demonstrate their knowledge through oral communication. However, it can still be vulnerable to AI-generated content that mimics the structure and flow of an oral defense.

- **Group presentations** can also be vulnerable to AI misuse since AI can generate scripts and even present them effectively. However, group presentations are typically more interactive and collaborative, allowing for more nuanced and dynamic exchanges, which can make it harder for AI to fully replicate.

In summary, project logs with version history are generally considered the most resilient to AI misuse because they involve a deeper level of understanding, application, and critical thinking, making it significantly more difficult for AI to replicate without understanding the underlying concepts.",/root/autodl-tmp/models/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct,0.7,0.9,1024,TRUE,,2025-11-21T20:20:54.602960

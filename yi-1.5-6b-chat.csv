"Effect of AI on originality of typical essays
A More original · B No change · C Less original","The effect of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the originality of typical essays can be categorized into three options:

A. More original
B. No change
C. Less original

**Argument for Option A: More original**

AI, particularly in the form of text generators like GPT-3 (the latest iteration from OpenAI), has the potential to significantly enhance the originality of essays. These AI systems are trained on vast amounts of text data, which allows them to understand and generate text that is semantically and structurally coherent. By analyzing the nuances of human language and the way ideas are expressed, AI can produce content that is not only grammatically correct but also stylistically similar to human-written essays. This means that AI can create essays that are original in their content and ideas, as long as those ideas are not protected by copyright laws. The challenge lies in the generation of ideas that are genuinely novel, which is where human creativity comes into play. However, in terms of the format, structure, and expression of ideas, AI can contribute to more original essays by mimicking the patterns and styles that humans are accustomed to.

**Argument for Option B: No change**

The argument that AI has no effect on the originality of essays suggests that the essays produced by AI are no different from those written by humans. This perspective overlooks the transformative potential of AI in terms of text generation. While it's true that AI can generate essays that are structurally and grammatically correct, the challenge with this approach is that it relies on the vast datasets from which it learns. If the training data for an AI essay generator includes a wide range of essays that have already been written, the AI might inadvertently produce content that is repetitive or closely mirrors existing essays, rather than creating truly original work. The effectiveness of AI in generating original content depends on the diversity and uniqueness of the data it is trained on, which can vary significantly depending on the AI's design and the quality of the input data.

**Argument for Option C: Less original**

The argument that AI makes essays less original suggests that the reliance on AI for essay generation could lead to a decline in the originality of content. This perspective focuses on the potential for AI to produce content that is derivative or lacks unique thought. When AI is used to generate essays, especially in contexts where the content is expected to be original, there is a risk that the AI might produce text that is too similar to existing works or that lacks the depth and creativity that distinguish human-written essays. This is particularly true if the AI is not programmed to generate truly novel ideas or if the training data does not include a wide enough range of unique perspectives and expressions. In such cases, the reliance on AI for essay generation could lead to less original content, as the focus shifts towards replicating patterns rather than creating something genuinely new.

In conclusion, the effect of AI on the originality of typical essays is complex and depends on various factors, including the quality and diversity of the training data, the sophistication of the AI algorithms, and the specific goals of the essay generation process. While AI has the potential to enhance the originality of essays by mimicking human expression and creativity, the actual impact will vary based on how these systems are designed and used.",/root/autodl-tmp/models/Yi-1.5-6B-Chat,0.7,0.9,1024,TRUE,,2025-11-21T20:23:07.014557

"Best practice to curb hallucinations
A Chain-of-thought prompting · B Retrieval/citations · C Lower temperature · D Model switching/ensemble","Creating a best practice to curb hallucinations in language models involves a combination of strategies. Let's break it down based on the options you've provided:

C. Lower temperature: Lowering the temperature of a language model generally makes the outputs more deterministic and less creative. This can help to reduce the occurrence of hallucinations, which are generated from the model's internal distribution rather than from the input data. By reducing the temperature, the model is more likely to generate text that is more aligned with the input, thus reducing hallucinations.

D. Model switching/ensemble: This approach involves using multiple models and combining their outputs to reduce the likelihood of hallucinations. By diversifying the model's responses, the ensemble can provide a more reliable output, as different models may generate different hallucinations, which are then averaged out in the ensemble. This method can be particularly effective when dealing with complex or nuanced topics where the hallucinations can be more easily detected and corrected.

A. Chain-of-thought prompting: This involves guiding the model with clear, structured questions to ensure that the output is grounded in reality. By prompting the model to justify its statements, it is less likely to generate hallucinations, as the model is forced to rely on real-world evidence rather than its own internal hallucinations.

B. Retrieval/citations: Implementing a retrieval-based model can help to reduce hallucinations by drawing from a pool of verified information. This method involves selecting the most relevant passages from a database rather than generating new text from scratch, which can help to mitigate the risk of hallucinations.

By combining these strategies, one can create a comprehensive best practice for curbing hallucinations in language models:

1. Lower the temperature of the model to reduce creativity and increase alignment with input data.
2. Use model switching or ensemble techniques to diversify outputs and reduce the likelihood of hallucinations.
3. Prompt the model with clear, structured questions to ground its responses in reality.
4. Implement a retrieval-based system to draw from a pool of verified information, rather than generating new text from scratch.

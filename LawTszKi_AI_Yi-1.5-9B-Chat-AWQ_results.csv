"Share of students using AI at least 3 days/week for coursework?
A <25% · B 25–49% · C 50–74% · D >75%","As of my last update in June 2023, there isn't a specific, universally accepted statistic on the share of students using AI for coursework at least 3 days/week, broken down into the categories A, B, C, or D. However, the adoption of AI in education is rapidly growing, with many educators and students finding it useful for tasks such as writing assistance, understanding complex topics, and even exam preparation.

Research suggests that the use of AI in education is increasing, with some surveys indicating that a significant portion of students are using AI tools for educational purposes. However, specific figures dividing the usage into categories A, B, C, or D as you've listed are not consistently reported in the available data. 

According to a report by the Pew Research Center in 2021, a growing number of teenagers and young adults are using AI-driven apps and tools, including educational platforms, for homework help and studying. While the report doesn't break down the exact percentage that uses AI tools for coursework 3 days or more per week, the trend suggests that the usage is increasing.

Educational institutions and students in more advanced stages of education (e.g., college and university) are more likely to use AI for coursework, given their more complex subjects and the need for advanced research and writing assistance. 

Given the rapid growth of AI in education and the increasing reliance on digital tools for learning, it's plausible to speculate that the share of students using AI for at least 3 days of coursework per week could be close to or exceed the 75% mark, aligning with category D. However, without specific, recent data, it's challenging to accurately categorize the usage into one of the provided categories.

For the most current statistics, one would need to refer to recent studies or surveys conducted by educational research institutions, technology companies focusing on education, or reputable data journalism organizations that have surveyed students' usage of AI in their educational activities.",/root/autodl-tmp/models/Yi-1.5-9B-Chat-AWQ,0.7,0.9,1024,TRUE,,2025-11-21T20:23:53.030757

"Net learning effect of AI for a typical user
A Strongly harmful · B Slightly harmful · C Slightly beneficial · D Strongly beneficial","The net learning effect of AI for a typical user can be considered as ""D Strongly beneficial."" This is because AI technologies, when applied appropriately, can significantly enhance learning experiences by personalizing content, facilitating access to vast amounts of information, and adapting to the learning pace and style of individual users. AI-driven educational platforms can provide interactive learning environments, offering immediate feedback, adaptive learning paths, and the ability to customize content to match the learner's background and goals.

However, it's important to note that this answer is contingent on several factors, including the quality of implementation of AI in education, the design of the AI algorithms, and the context in which they are used. While AI can be strongly beneficial, there are also potential downsides, such as:

1. **Mitigation of Learning Process**: AI can simplify learning processes, potentially reducing the cognitive load on learners but also diminishing the learning experience.

2. **Privacy Concerns**: The use of AI in learning can raise privacy concerns, especially if AI systems collect and analyze personal data.

3. **Accessibility Issues**: Not all users may have equal access to AI technologies, leading to disparities in educational opportunities.

4. **Dependency on Technology**: Over-reliance on AI tools for learning could potentially hinder the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills that are not directly supported by AI.

5. **Ethical and Bias Issues**: AI systems, if not properly designed and monitored, can perpetuate or even create biases, affecting the fairness and effectiveness of learning outcomes.

Despite these considerations, the general consensus and practical application in education point towards AI having a strongly beneficial net learning effect for typical users, especially when used thoughtfully and responsibly.",/root/autodl-tmp/models/Yi-1.5-9B-Chat-AWQ,0.7,0.9,1024,TRUE,,2025-11-21T20:23:53.030783
"Main risk students face from AI use

C Privacy/data leakage
B Plagiarism/academic integrity issues
D Over-reliance/loss of skills
A Hallucinated facts

1. **C Privacy/data leakage**: When students use AI, especially in educational or personal contexts, their data is often used to improve the AI's performance. This can include personal information, study habits, and even sometimes sensitive data. The risk of privacy leakage is real, as there have been instances where AI systems have been found to have access to or have shared user data without proper consent or security measures.

2. **B Plagiarism/academic integrity issues**: AI-powered tools can generate text, solve problems, and even write code. While these capabilities can be beneficial for learning and research, they also pose a risk of plagiarism. Students might use these tools without proper attribution, leading to violations of academic integrity standards.

3. **D Over-reliance/loss of skills**: There's a risk that students may become overly reliant on AI for tasks that are better suited for human learning, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and creative thinking. This over-reliance could lead to a loss of skills that are essential for independent learning and future employment.

4. **A Hallucinated facts**: While this risk is more theoretical and less directly impactful on students as compared to others, AI, especially in its current form, can generate plausible but false information. This could lead to the propagation of misinformation if students rely on AI-generated content without verifying its accuracy. However, this risk is more about the content quality and less about the direct impact on students' learning or well-being compared to the other listed risks.

Education institutions and AI developers are increasingly aware of these risks and are working on mitigating them through better data management practices, ethical AI guidelines, and teaching students how to critically evaluate the output of AI systems.",/root/autodl-tmp/models/Yi-1.5-9B-Chat-AWQ,0.7,0.9,1024,TRUE,,2025-11-21T20:23:53.030792

"Students compare their work to AI outputs…
A Rarely · B Sometimes · C Often · D Almost always","The comparison between students' work and AI outputs can vary significantly depending on the task, the sophistication of the AI system, and the level of education and expertise of the student. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B Sometimes

AI can generate text, create art, solve problems, and perform other tasks with a level of precision and speed that can sometimes match or even exceed that of human students, especially in areas where the AI has been specifically trained. However, it's important to note that while AI can perform these tasks ""sometimes"" with the same quality as human students, it often lacks the depth of understanding, creativity, and contextual knowledge that human thought can bring. Additionally, AI's output can be influenced by its training data and algorithms, which may lead to biases or limitations in its output.

The other options are not accurate for the following reasons:

A) Rarely - This would imply that AI's output is significantly less capable than human students, which is not always the case, especially as AI technology advances.

C) Often - While it's true that AI can perform tasks ""often"" on par with human students, this choice doesn't account for the variability in tasks and the inherent differences between human and AI capabilities.

D) Almost always - This statement is overly broad and does not accurately reflect the range of tasks and contexts in which AI's performance can vary. There are many tasks where AI's output may not always ""almost always"" match that of human students, especially in creative, nuanced, or ethically complex domains.",/root/autodl-tmp/models/Yi-1.5-9B-Chat-AWQ,0.7,0.9,1024,TRUE,,2025-11-21T20:23:57.109318
"Effect of AI on originality of typical essays
A More original · B No change · C Less original","The effect of AI on the originality of typical essays can be seen as ""C Less original."" As AI tools, including language models, become more prevalent in the writing process, there is a significant impact on the originality of the content produced. Here's why:

1. **Overuse of Predictive Writing**: AI tools are designed to predict and generate text based on patterns they've learned from vast amounts of data. This means that if an AI is used to draft or even proofread an essay, it may inadvertently introduce language and ideas that are already widely recognized or overused, thereby reducing the originality of the essay.

2. **Lack of Creativity**: AI, by its very nature, is not creative in the human sense. It does not generate new ideas from scratch; it combines existing data to produce outputs. This means that while AI can help in organizing thoughts and refining language, it does not contribute to the creation of novel ideas, which is a crucial aspect of originality in writing.

3. **Simplification of Complex Ideas**: When AI is used to summarize or explain complex ideas, it often simplifies them to a degree that might not be necessary for maintaining originality. This simplification can lead to a loss of nuance and depth, which are vital for maintaining the unique perspective that characterizes original work.

4. **Risk of Plagiarism**: With AI-generated text or AI-assisted writing, there is a growing risk of unintentionally plagiarizing sources that are part of the AI's training data. This is particularly concerning for students and writers who rely on AI to draft or summarize their work without proper attribution, leading to accusations of plagiarism.

5. **Dependency and Cognitive Shifts**: There's also a psychological aspect to consider. As writers become more reliant on AI for assistance, there might be a shift in their cognitive processes. They might start to view AI as a tool that can generate original content itself, leading to a decrease in their own initiative and creativity in writing.

In conclusion, while AI can be a powerful tool for enhancing the clarity, coherence, and efficiency of writing, its widespread use can potentially reduce the originality of typical essays. Writers and educators are increasingly aware of this issue and are exploring ways to balance the benefits of AI with the preservation of originality and critical thinking skills.",/root/autodl-tmp/models/Yi-1.5-9B-Chat-AWQ,0.7,0.9,1024,TRUE,,2025-11-21T20:23:57.109340
"Impulsive purchases driven by AI recommendations/ads
A Rare · B Occasional (monthly) · C Frequent (weekly) · D Very frequent (multi/week)","Impulsive purchases driven by AI recommendations or ads can vary in frequency depending on the effectiveness of the AI in predicting and influencing consumer behavior. Here's a breakdown based on the options provided:

A) Rare:
- This scenario would represent instances where AI-driven recommendations or ads are not persuasive or relevant enough to prompt impulsive purchases. This could be due to poor algorithmic accuracy, lack of personalization, or the AI not understanding the consumer's actual needs and preferences well enough to make compelling offers.

B) Occasional (monthly)：
- AI-driven recommendations might occasionally lead to impulsive purchases, especially if the AI has a good understanding of user preferences and behavior, and makes highly relevant and enticing suggestions. This frequency suggests that while AI is capable of influencing consumer decisions, it's not consistently or heavily impacting purchasing habits.

C) Frequent (weekly)：
- A frequency of weekly impulsive purchases indicates that AI recommendations or ads are highly effective and frequently influence consumer decisions. This could be due to the AI's ability to provide highly relevant and personalized content, tailored to the user's interests and purchasing history. This scenario suggests a more advanced and sophisticated AI system that is deeply integrated into the consumer's online and purchasing behavior.

D) Very Frequent (multi/week)：
- This scenario represents the highest level of influence that AI recommendations or ads can have on impulsive purchases. Impulse buying is happening multiple times a week, which suggests a highly personalized and targeted AI system that not only understands the consumer's preferences but also influences their purchasing decisions in real-time. This level of AI effectiveness is more speculative and would require an AI system that is deeply integrated into the consumer's online activities and is capable of making highly relevant and timely recommendations.

In reality, the frequency of impulsive purchases driven by AI recommendations or ads could vary based on the quality of the AI algorithm, the nature of the products or services being recommended, the platform on which the AI operates, and the individual consumer's susceptibility to advertising and recommendation systems. Additionally, regulatory and ethical considerations around AI and consumer behavior are becoming increasingly important, which could impact the frequency and impact of AI-driven impulsive purchases.",/root/autodl-tmp/models/Yi-1.5-9B-Chat-AWQ,0.7,0.9,1024,TRUE,,2025-11-21T20:23:57.109350
"Most persuasive channel for AI-driven purchases
A TikTok/Reels shopping · B Search ads · C Marketplace recs (Amazon/Temu) · D Creator newsletters","As of my last update in 2023, the most persuasive channel for AI-driven purchases appears to be C) Marketplace recommendations (Amazon/Temu). This choice aligns with several key factors that contribute to the effectiveness of AI in influencing consumer purchasing decisions, particularly in the context of e-commerce platforms:

1. **Personalization**: AI-driven recommendation systems on platforms like Amazon and Temu use sophisticated algorithms to understand user behavior and preferences. This personalization significantly enhances the relevance of the products they recommend, making them more likely to be of interest to the user, thus increasing the persuasiveness of the recommendations.

2. **Contextual Relevance**: Unlike search ads or content-based platforms (like TikTok or creator newsletters), marketplace recommendations can be highly contextual. For example, a user might be looking for a specific item on Amazon, and the platform can leverage this context to suggest complementary products that the user might also be interested in. This contextual relevance is a powerful tool for persuading users to make additional purchases.

3. **Continuous Learning**: Marketplace recommendations can continuously learn from user interactions. If a user ends up buying a product because of a recommendation, the platform can learn that this recommendation was effective and use this knowledge to recommend similar products to other users. This iterative process improves the persuasiveness of future recommendations.

4. **Integration with User Behavior**: Unlike search ads, which rely on the user's search queries, marketplace recommendations are not dependent on active searching. Instead, they are triggered by various user behaviors, including browsing, searching, and even the absence of explicit searching for a particular item. This broad coverage ensures that users are exposed to relevant recommendations regardless of their activity level, making the AI-driven purchasing influence more pervasive.

While TikTok/Reels shopping, search ads, and creator newsletters also leverage AI to varying degrees, the specific combination of personalization, contextual relevance, continuous learning, and pervasive exposure makes marketplace recommendations by platforms like Amazon and Temu the most persuasive channel for AI-driven purchases. These platforms are continually refining their AI algorithms to better understand and influence consumer behavior, making them highly effective in persuading users to make purchases.",/root/autodl-tmp/models/Yi-1.5-9B-Chat-AWQ,0.7,0.9,1024,TRUE,,2025-11-21T20:23:57.109358
"Best practice to curb hallucinations
A Chain-of-thought prompting · B Retrieval/citations · C Lower temperature · D Model switching/ensemble","A Chain-of-thought prompting

When dealing with hallucinations, especially in a clinical or research context, the best practice to curb or manage them involves using chain-of-thought prompting (A). This approach encourages the individual to express their thoughts in a structured manner, which can help in understanding the origins of the hallucinations and in developing strategies to counteract them.

Other options and their implications:

B. Retrieval/citations: While reviewing and citing relevant literature can provide insights into the causes, symptoms, and treatments of hallucinations, simply retrieving or citing information without applying it directly to the individual's case does not actively curb hallucinations.

C. Lower temperature: This option seems unrelated to curbing hallucinations. Temperature control is not a standard approach for managing or reducing hallucinations in clinical or research settings.

D. Model switching/ensemble: In the context of artificial intelligence or machine learning, model switching or ensemble can refer to changing algorithms or using multiple algorithms together to improve predictions or outcomes. However, this does not directly apply to curbing hallucinations in humans, as hallucinations are not typically managed through artificial intelligence algorithms without a human-in-the-loop component.
